            <h2>Sergeant Samuel James Barley</h2>
            <h3>#113073 / Killed in action / Toronto Daily Star, July 4th, 1916</h3>

                    Sergeant Samuel James Barley was born on March 19th, 1885 in Billston Staffordshire, England.1 Sergeant Barley signed his attestation papers on February 4th, 19152 and subsequently officially enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in Toronto on February 24th, 1915 at the age of 29.3 Sergeant Barley lived in Winnipeg for twelve years working as the vice-president of a wholesale drug company.4 The Toronto Daily Star reported him as having written many letters about his time serving in the army and stated that ‚Äúthe military experience is wonderful and he valued his training...‚Äù.5 On January 8th, 1915, Sergeant Barley was discharged from the Canadian Expeditionary Force while in France due to demobilization and medical unfitness.

                    According to Sergeant Barley‚Äôs casualty form, he transferred to overseas service with the 8th infantry brigade on January 28th, 1916.7 The 8th battalion was comprised mostly of recruits from Winnipeg and consisted of 47 officers and 1,106 other ranks.8 On June 2nd of 1916, Sergeant Samuel James Barley was reported missing. The timelines become rather confusing because on July 4th, 1916, Sergeant Samuel James Barley is tragically reported to have been killed in action by the Toronto Daily Star9 yet there are papers entitled ‚ÄúMedical History of an Invalid'' which are dated from February 19th, 1917 which insisted on Sergeant Barley‚Äôs discharge and subsequent return to Canada.10 Due to the rather conflicting timelines, it could be possible that Sergeant Samuel James Barley‚Äôs death was falsely reported in the Toronto Star and that he could have survived the war completely. There is a grave located in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario that is addressed to Lance Corporal Samuel J. Barley and is inscripted with ‚Äú4th CMR CEF‚Äù with the birth date being unknown and the date of death being August 15th, 1948.

There is record of Colonel Creelman participating in the 1901 Canadian census at the age of 20 where he resided in Ward 1 (which according to Goad‚Äôs Map would have been around the Queen Street East area).12 Colonel Creelman studied liberal arts at Upper Canada College (also known as Victoria College at the University of Toronto) and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1904 and moved to Montreal in 1905 where he studied law at McGill University.

Captain Chambers was a part of the 4th Battalion which consisted of 44 officers and 1,121 other ranks25 and enlisted officially on September 22nd, 1914.26 According to Captain Chambers‚Äô service file, he was discharged from service on March 14th, 1916 in England due to being wounded in the upper jaw.27Captain Chambers transferred to the Imperial Royal Flying Corps28 on April 15th, 191629.

According to the Toronto Star, he was wounded in the Battle of Langemarck.32 Captain Percy Wilmot Chambers was killed on August 13th, 1917 at the age of 29 and the cause of his death remains unknown. Captain Chambers died in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France and was buried in Douai Communal Cemetery.33 The inscription of his grave reads ‚ÄúDied and lived for others. Loving Memory.

                <h5 class="font-weight-normal">
                    The research that I have conducted since submitting the initial draft has been quite
                    substantial. Before I began to research for other parts of my final draft, I made sure to go back and thoroughly look through each of the soldiers' respective war diaries and military service files. I particularly combed through each soldier's service files again to see if there was any information that I had missed the first time around that could be useful to use in my final draft which proved to be extremely helpful as I found quite a lot more information in regards to certain soldiers discharge circumstances like Private Herbert Rance and Colonel John Jennings Creelman. While for some soldiers retracing my initial steps and going through their service files proved to be helpful, it became more confusing for others.

                <h5 class="font-weight-normal">
                    Take Sergeant Samuel James Barley for instance, his military service file becomes quite confusing and the circumstances of his death remain unclear despite the Toronto Star reporting him to have been killed in action. I became skeptical and attempted to do further research and found a grave addressed to a Lance Corporal Samuel James Barley. The reason why I am unsure whether it is actually him or not is because there is no specific birth date and he was the only Samuel James Barley registered in the system on Find A Grave that was buried in Toronto. I attempted to research through more Toronto Star postings to see if there was any further information on each soldier‚Äôs circumstances and whether or not they survived the war. Initially I spent a lot of time doing this for Sergeant Samuel James Barley and struggled to find anything, however, I did find another news posting for Captain Percy Wilmot Chambers that stated he had become a prisoner of war in Germany. Between the news postings I found about Captain Chambers, his military service file, and date of death on his grave I can confirm that he was likely killed while being kept a prisoner by the Germans after the Battle of Langemarck.

            <div class="container d-flex mb-4 justify-content-center">
                <h5 class="font-weight-normal">
                    Now that I had successfully retraced my steps and found extra information, I began to research for my final draft. For each soldier I followed the same formula of searching through the City of Toronto Archives, Canadian Census Records, Goad‚Äôs Atlas, and Find a Grave. In Captain Chamber‚Äôs article, it stated that he resided at 431 Windermere avenue and when I curiously typed the address into Google Maps to see if the residence was still standing or what it has turned into now, I see that it has turned into a hair salon located in Bloor West Village that I myself have walked past and driven past countless times while living in the area myself which was a fascinating realization and almost made me feel a lot closer to the soldier I chose. A lot of the soldier‚Äôs that I chose didn‚Äôt appear in any of the Canadian Census records save for Colonel Creelman in which I was able to locate his ward using the Goad‚Äôs Atlas. I struggled to find pictures relevant in the City of Toronto Archives but ironically enough what helped me the most in my final draft research was Find a Grave. I was able to locate each soldier‚Äôs grave (except for Private Rance) and that was able to tell me (for the most part) their birth date, death date, and the cemetery where they are buried. Their death date also told me right away whether or not they survived the war and based on that I was able to retrace their military service file and look for discharge papers and discharge dates.
